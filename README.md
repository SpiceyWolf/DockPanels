Weifen Luo's DockPanel Suite.

Version removes themes from modification, direct access to skin info, code cleanup, (Hopefully) optimization, and code standardization accourding to ReSharper.

Changes are made by ArchaicSoft and any potential copywrite issues/infringement should be reported to ArchaicSoft immediately for corrections.

At this current time, you may contact SpiceyWolf on AscendingCreations.com or pm the github poster.
